                    <b>Local Storage</b> is a type of web storage that allows JavaScript to store and access data right in the browser. This is especially useful for storing data that you want to persist even if the user closes the browser, such as preferences or settings.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Session Storage</b> is a type of web storage that allows web applications to store data locally within the user's browser. Unlike cookies, data stored in session storage is specific to the site on which it was created and data is not shared with other sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when the user closes its browser window.</li>
                    <li>sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has three tabs open, each one will have its own page session.</li>
                    <li>Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or manually.</li>

            <div>
                <p><i class="fa-solid fa-terminal icon"></i>
                    <b>Global Scope</b>: A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks. <br>
                    <b>Block Scope</b>: A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Block Scope:</h4>
                    In ES6, a new way to declare variable is introduced -- const and let. Before ES6, developers use var to declare different variables. 
                    <li>const: const is used when you don't want to reassign the variable. It stays constant once it's declared. As a result, const is always a default option for me if I don't need to reassign the variable. In this way, we can also avoid the case when we occasionally declare the same variable name in other files.</li>
                    <li>let: When it comes to the situation I need to reassign a variable, let is more welcome than var after ES6. The reason is that let is in block scope which means it only exists within its own scope</li>
                    <h4>Global Scope:</h4>
                    <li>var: var is an old way to declare variable in javaScript and it's now the weakest keyword to define a variable. The variable declared by var may or may not be reassigned and because it is in function scope, the variable may or may not be used for entire function. If the variable is reassigned accidentally within a for loop (block scope), then that's when things can easily go wrong. People can overwrite the parent assignments in this case. </li>

            <div>
                <p><i class="fa-solid fa-terminal icon"></i>
                    <b>The event Loop: </b> JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java. <br>
                    JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that JavaScript can do only one thing at a single point in time.

                    The JavaScript engine executes a script from the top of the file and works its way down. It creates the execution contexts, pushes, and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution phase.

                    If a function takes a long time to execute, you cannot interact with the web browser during the function's execution because the page hangs.

                    A function that takes a long time to complete is called a blocking function. Technically, a blocking function blocks all the interactions on the webpage, such as mouse click. In that time we can wait for the task to complete. A very interesting property of the event loop model is that JavaScript, unlike a lot of other languages, never blocks

                    The event loop is the secret by which JavaScript gives us an illusion of being multithreaded even though it is single-threaded.

                <p><i class="fa-solid fa-terminal icon"></i>
                    The undefined is a primitive type in JavaScript. So the undefined is a type. And the undefined type has exactly one value that is undefined.
                    <li>The undefined is a primitive type that has a single value undefined.</li>
                    <li>Accessing an uninitialized variable returns undefined</li>
                    <li>Accessing a non-existing property of an object returns undefined</li>
                    <li>Function parameters</li>
                    <li>Functions return a value</li>
                    <li>Accessing out-of-bounds array elements</li>
